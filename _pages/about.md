I am a postdoctoral research fellow in International Relations at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/universitaet/schools/school-of-economics-and-political-science-seps/), School of Economics and Political Science. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with the [Boston University Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/). I received my PhD from the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/), in December 2022.

My research focuses on the political economy of international organizations to understand global development, public health, and inequality. I am particularly interested in the micro-foundations of state action in global governance --- including questions of strategic behavior by powerful member-states as well as voice & representation of relatively weaker states --- using primarily text-as-data, regression analysis, and expert interviews.

Currently, I am pursuing the following research questions:

* What is the IMF's and multilateral development banks' role in fighting climate change?
* How does deliberation contribute to decision-making of international organizations?
* What strategies do states and state representatives use to pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?

My research has appeared in <i>International Affairs</i>, <i>Journal of European Public Policy</i>, and <i>Global Policy</i>, among others. I have been funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and the University of St.Gallen's basic research fund. My dissertation was awarded the 2023 [Ernst-Reuter Prize](https://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/alumni/teilnehmen/ert/ert-2023/index.html) for the best dissertation in the Social Sciences at the Freie Universität Berlin.
