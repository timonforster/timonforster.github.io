I am a postdoctoral research fellow in International Relations at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/universitaet/schools/school-of-economics-and-political-science-seps/)'s School of Economics and Political Science, funded by the university's basic research fund. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with the [Boston University Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/). I received my PhD from the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/), Germany, in December 2022.

My research focuses on the political economy of international organizations to understand global development, public health, and inequality. I am particularly interested in the micro-foundations of state action in global governance --- including questions of strategic behavior by powerful member-states as well as voice & representation of relatively weaker states --- using primarily text-as-data, regression analysis, and expert interviews.

Currently, I am pursuing the following research questions:

* What is the IMF's and multilateral development banks' role in fighting climate change?
* How does deliberation contribute to decision-making of international organizations?
* What strategies do states and state representatives use to pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?
