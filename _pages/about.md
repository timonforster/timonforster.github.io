I am a postdoctoral research fellow in International Relations at the [University of St Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/universitaet/schools/school-of-economics-and-political-science-seps/), School of Economics and Political Science. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with the [Boston University Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/). I received my PhD from the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/), in December 2022.

In January 2026, I will join the [Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI)](https://www.ibei.org/en) as an Assistant Professor in International Political Economy.

My research examines the political economy of international organizations, with a focus on how they shape global development, climate change, inequality, and public health. I explore the micro-foundations of state action in global governance using methods from computational social science, regression analysis, and expert interviews.

Currently, my research addresses questions such as:

* What is the IMF's and multilateral development banks' role in addressing climate change?
* How does deliberation contribute to decision-making of international organizations?
* What strategies do states and state representatives use to pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?

My work has appeared or is forthcoming in the <i>Review of International Organizations</i>, <i>Review of International Political Economy</i>, <i>International Affairs</i>, <i>Journal of European Public Policy</i>, and <i>Global Policy</i>, among others.

This research has been has been supported the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and the University of St Gallen.
