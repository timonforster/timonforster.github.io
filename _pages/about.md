I am a PhD Candidate in International Relations at the Berlin Graduate School for Global and Transregional Studies, Freie Universit√§t Berlin.

I am currently pursuing the following research questions:

* What is the role of deliberation in decision-making of international organizations?

* How do states pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?

* How does leaders' educational background shape their policy responses in times of crisis?

* What are the obstacles to a more progressive Green Deal in Europe?
