I am a PhD Candidate in International Relations at the [Berlin Graduate School for Global and Transregional Studies](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/), Freie Universit√§t Berlin, and a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow with the Global Economic Governance Initiative, [Boston University Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/profile/timon-forster/).

My research focuses on the political economy of international organizations (e.g., examining the effects and decisions of the IMF), public health & inequality, and leadership in times of crisis. I am particularly interested in studying the micro-foundations of state action in global governance using text-as-data, regression analysis, and expert interviews.

Currently, I am pursuing the following research questions:

* What is the role of deliberation in decision-making of international organizations?
* How do states pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?
* How do leaders and organizations respond to crises?
