I am a postdoctoral research fellow in International Relations at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/universitaet/schools/school-of-economics-and-political-science-seps/)'s School of Economics and Political Science, funded by the university's Basic Research Fund.

My research focuses on the political economy of international organizations to understand global development, public health, and inequality. I am particularly interested in the micro-foundations of state action in global governance --- including questions of strategic behavior by powerful member-states as well as voice & representation of relatively weaker states --- using text-as-data, regression analysis, and expert interviews.

Currently, I am pursuing the following research questions:

* What is the IMF's and multilateral development banks' role in fighting climate change?
* How does deliberation contribute to decision-making of international organizations?
* What strategies do states and state representatives use to pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?
