I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow with the Global Economic Governance Initiative, [Boston University Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/profile/timon-forster/).

My research focuses on the political economy of international organizations to understand global development, public health, and inequality. I am particularly interested in studying the micro-foundations of state action in global governance --- including questions of strategic behavior by powerful member-states as well as voice & representation of relatively weaker states --- using text-as-data, regression analysis, and expert interviews.

Currently, I am pursuing the following research questions:

* What is the IMF's role in fighting climate change?
* How does deliberation contribute to decision-making of international organizations?
* What strategies do states and state representatives use to pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?
