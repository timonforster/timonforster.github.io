I am a PhD Candidate in International Relations at the [Berlin Graduate School for Global and Transregional Studies](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/), Freie Universit√§t Berlin.

My research focuses on the political economy of international organizations (e.g., examining the effects and decisions of the IMF), public health & inequality, and leadership in times of crisis. I am particularly interested in studying the micro-foundations of state action in global governance using text-as-data and regression analysis.

Currently, I am pursuing the following research questions:

* What is the role of deliberation in decision-making of international organizations?
* How do states pursue their preferences in governing bodies of international organizations?
* How does leaders' education shape their policy responses to societal crises?

I am also a member of the [Foundation for European Progressive Studies](https://www.feps-europe.eu/) (FEPS) Young Academics Network (2020 cohort), where I am studying the politics of the Green Deal in Europe.
