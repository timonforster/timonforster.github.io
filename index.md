I am a political scientist working at the intersection of International Relations and International Political Economy. My research examines three interlinked themes: the international determinants of inequality; the governance and decision-making of international organizations; and the political economy of climate change, development, and global economic governance.

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [Institut Barcelona d’Estudis Internacionals (IBEI)](https://www.ibei.org/en), Spain. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of St Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/universitaet/schools/school-of-economics-and-political-science-seps/) and [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/). I received my PhD from the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/) in December 2022.

Methodologically, my work draws on mixed-methods approaches, with a particular emphasis on quantitative text analysis complemented by elite interviews.

My work has appeared in the <i>Review of International Organizations</i>, <i>Review of International Political Economy</i>, <i>International Affairs</i>, <i>Journal of European Public Policy</i>, and <i>Global Policy</i>, among others.

My research has been supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and the University of St Gallen. I am also the recipient of the 2023 [Ernst-Reuter Prize](https://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/alumni/teilnehmen/ert/ert-2023/index.html) for the best dissertation in the Social Sciences at the Freie Universität Berlin, the 2024 [Rudolf Wildenmann Prize](https://ecpr.eu/news/news/details/839) from the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR), and the 2024 [Young Scholar Award (Article)](https://www.svpw-assp.ch/news-archiv/news-archiv-details/awards-for-young-researchers-in-political-science) from the Swiss Political Science Association (SPSA).
